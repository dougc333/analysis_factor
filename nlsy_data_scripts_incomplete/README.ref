teh txt file is 5GB. at border of being too big to process in memory on single computer. 
can use a server but that doesnt scale
1_) map reduce on the text file to split each column into separate text files
2) combine columns together into dataframe of columns after separate text files

test on small scale first, each column separate csv file
