  An Overview of Effect Size Statistics and Why They Are So Important

An Overview of Effect Size Statistics and Why They Are So Important
 with Jeff Meyer

*Stage*
1 – The Fundamentals of Statistical Skill

*Step*
13 – Interpret results
<https://programs.theanalysisfactor.com/statistically-speaking/statistically-speaking-videos/stats-amore-core-content-video-the-pathway-steps/?vn=13>

Whenever we run an analysis of variance or a regression, one of the
first things we do is look at the p-value of our predictor variables to
determine whether they are statistically significant. But when the
variable is statistically significant, did you ever stop and ask
yourself how significant it is? How large of an impact does it actually
have on our outcome variable?

The American Psychological Association expects all published research to
answer that last question. But what statistics answer that?

This webinar will cover that topic and more.

In the webinar, we will go beyond “statistical significance” to
“practical significance,” and we will consider “how big of a difference”
rather than “is there a difference.” You probably know that the size of
our sample can have a very large impact on the p-value of a predictor
variable. We’ll discuss how using effect size statistics will help us
avoid the interpretational quagmire created by sample size.

In addition, we’ll discuss the "two families" of effect size, the /d
family/ (differences between groups) and the /r family/ (measures of
association). We’ll learn how to measure and interpret their results.
There is much to cover!
