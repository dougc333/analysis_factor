Confidence Intervals

Confidence Intervals
 with Jeff Meyer

*Stage*
1 – The Fundamentals of Statistical Skill

*Component*

*Step*
13 – Interpret results
<https://programs.theanalysisfactor.com/statistically-speaking/statistically-speaking-videos/stats-amore-core-content-video-the-pathway-steps/?vn=13>

A /Science News/ article from July 2014 was titled “Scientists’ grasp of
confidence intervals doesn’t inspire confidence.” Perhaps that is why
only 11% of the articles in the 10 leading psychology journals in 2006
reported confidence intervals in their statistical analysis.

How important is it to be able to create and interpret confidence intervals?

The American Psychological Association Publication Manual, which sets
the editorial standards for over 1,000 journals in the behavioral, life,
and social sciences, has begun emphasizing parameter estimation and
de-emphasizing Null Hypothesis Significance Testing (NHST).

Its most recent edition, the sixth, published in 2009, states “estimates
of appropriate effect sizes and confidence intervals are the /minimum/
expectations” for published research.

In this webinar, we’ll clear up the ambiguity as to what exactly is a
confidence interval and how to interpret them in a table and graph
format. We will also explore how they are calculated for continuous and
dichotomous outcome variables in various types of samples and understand
the impact sample size has on the width of the band. We’ll discuss
related concepts like equivalence testing.

By the end of the webinar, we anticipate your grasp of confidence
intervals will inspire confidence.
