The Fundamentals of Sample Size Calculations

The Fundamentals of Sample Size Calculations

*Step*
5 – Estimate sample size
<https://programs.theanalysisfactor.com/statistically-speaking/statistically-speaking-videos/stats-amore-core-content-video-the-pathway-steps/?vn=5>

Sample size estimates are one of those data analysis tasks that look
straightforward, then once you try to do one, make you want to bang your
head against the computer in frustration. Or, maybe that’s just me.

Regardless of how they make you feel, they are super important to do for
your study before you collect the data. As tempting as it is to skip or
fudge this task, it will only lead to bigger headaches later on when
data collection takes forever or you discover you don’t have enough data
to test your hypotheses.

So how do you actually do them, and how to do you understand the many,
many issues involved?

In this month’s Stat’s Amore webinar, we will lay out the seven steps to
run an accurate sample size estimate. Some of them are super easy (like
#2: choose an alpha level). Others are much harder to do in practice
than they look (#3: specify the smallest effect size of scientific
interest).

We will also discuss some fundamental concepts that you need to really
wrap your head around. They will help you understand how to approach
these seven steps. And more importantly they’ll help you understand why
you must avoid some of the common but bad practices that are often
recommended by well-meaning advisors and what to do when you’ve hit a
tricky sample-size situation.
