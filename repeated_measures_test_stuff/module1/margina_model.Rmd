This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
install.packages("geepack")
library("geepack")
```
```{r}
dat <- data.frame(id = c(1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4), condition = factor(c(1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2)), personality = c(2.5, 2.5, 4.0, 4.0, 3.3, 3.3, 4.2, 4.2),emotion = c(5.0, 4.9, 2.6, 2.3, 4.3, 2.9, 1.0, 1.0))
dat
```
```{r}
my_mod <- geeglm(emotion ~ condition*personality, data = dat, id = id)
summary(my_mod)
```



Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
