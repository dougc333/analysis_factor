## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
```
```{r}
colnames(diamonds)
ggplot(diamonds,aes(x=carat,y=price))+geom_point(size=0.5,alpha=0.5)+labs(title="diamonds",x="Carat",y="Price")
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```
```{r}
demo(package = .packages(all.available = TRUE))
```
```{r}
#install.packages("lindia")
library(lindia)
library(car)
library(MASS)
cars_lm <- lm(Price ~ Passengers + Length + RPM, data = Cars93)
gg_diagnose(cars_lm)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
