Power Analysis and Sample Size determination using Simulaiton




Effect size. 
You can have 2 drugs which have significant p values but dont kmow how to
compare them. 
A p value indicates statistically significant but you dont know teh effect size
if it is meaningful or not. The larger sample sizes produce a higher p value.

Inference
given a pvalue from a sample how do we use this to infer something about the
population? 
We use teh hypothesis testing framework to deal with random variations. We
assume teh null hypothesis is true(no effect) and we find a probability that
a new sample from teh same populaiton would produce teh same extreme test
statistic as from our current sample.
