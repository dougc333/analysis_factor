Statistics is, to a large extent, a science of comparison. You are
trying to test whether one group is bigger, faster, or smarter than another.

You do this by setting up a null hypothesis that your two groups have
equal means or proportions and an alternative hypothesis that one group
is “better” than the other. The test has interesting results only when
the data you collect ends up rejecting the null hypothesis.

But there are times when the interesting research question you’re asking
is not about whether one group is better than the other, but whether the
two groups are equivalent.

For example, at which point do second-language speakers make as few
grammar errors as native speakers?

Or at which point does a new drug with fewer side effects work just as
well as the standard treatment?

Finding equivalence is impossible, by conventional wisdom. You can’t
prove a negative. (Well, you can prove a negative, but it takes more work.)

There is an entirely different hypothesis testing framework that allows
for this kind of comparison.

In this webinar, we’ll review the framework of the traditional
hypothesis test and compare it to the framework of the equivalence test
and its one-sided cousin, the non-inferiority test.

You’ll learn how to specify a range of equivalence or margin of
non-inferiority, where those values define differences that are small
enough to be tolerable.

You’ll also identify critical issues in the design of an equivalence or
non-inferiority study that can make or break your experiment.
