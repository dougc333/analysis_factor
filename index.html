#Statistics with Analysis Factor#
<a href="https://www.theanalysisfactor.com/">Analysis factor</a> is the source for this material on
statistics. There is a program where you can subscribe to a Q/A chat to work on projects. Most of this material
comes from projects with Analysis Factor. The models aren't plug and play like what you see in youtube videos
or R packages.

The specific problem with dashboards which display contents of a database is it doesn't educate the user
if a value is higher than another value is that a desirable effect or is that random variation? If a store sells
10 on one day then 8 on another, does it mean 10 is better than 8 because of some factor or is that random variation.

This analysis for dashboards have to be embedded into the visualization to make them useful.

Effect Sizes:


Repeated Measures: one of the assumptions for calculating effect sizes with regression
is the data is iid. Applying a treatment to a treatment group vs a control and measure for effectvoiulates
the iid assumption when xxx.
