```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(tidyr)
library(readr)
library(dplyr)
tolerance <- read.table("https://stats.idre.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/tolerance1.txt", sep=",", header=T)
print(tolerance)
```

```{r}
#the tolerance columns, rows 2-6 are tolerance columns, we want the covariance matrix for tolerance columns
cor(tolerance[,2:6]) %>% round(digits=2)

```


```{reformatted the data from col to rows}
tolerance.pp <- read.table("https://stats.idre.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/tolerance1_pp.txt", sep=",", header=T)

attach(tolerance.pp)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r tolerance, echo=FALSE}
plot(tolerance)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
