Description
The researcher conducted an experiment with 220 college students to determine how characteristics of the witness and the observer affected observersâ€™ perceptions of elderly witnesses in a fictitious trial.

The witness was said to have seen a car accident in which a child was hit by a car.  The eyewitness testimony was crucial to determine whether the child fell and hit his head because he was struck by the car or whether the child fell on ice and hit his head in front of the car before being struck.  The details of this testimony were crucial for determining if the defendant was criminally responsible of involuntary manslaughter.

Each participant read a transcript of the testimony and was told the witness was one of four ages and either male or female.
