process 5B data from 2014 birth data to dataframe 
lesson learned; always write code, easier to add the length of each column because
you can read it faster and only 1 keystroke vs. 1-3 keystroke entries * 2 for each start and
stop location per column. 

KeyEntry strokes as metric for time it takes to manually process data. 

also easier to keep in memory single digit length of column vs start and stop positions. can do more in parallel with single digits. use patterns like 15 1s in a row. Much faster, 10x or more faster with column lengths.
