Description
The National Longitudinal Study of Youth (79) is a nationally representative sample of 12,686 young men and women who were 14-22 years old when they were first surveyed in 1979. These individuals were interviewed annually through 1994 and are currently interviewed on a biennial basis.

Research Questions
Does religiosity, as measured by religious attendance, affect physical and mental health, as measured by PCS and CES-D, controlling for education and number of children in the household.

Although this is a longitudinal data set, this study used only the 2000 data.
